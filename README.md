# WordBook

WordBook is a mobile application that you can practice your vocabulary. You can see the words that you have added, their meanings and usage in some example sentences. The data has been manually added to the JSON file for now, but in the future it will be stored in Firebase and users will be able to enter new data from the app. **It developed by using React Native (Expo CLI)**.



## Getting Started

In your terminal change into project folder that you created then run:
```bash
npm install
```
to install required dependencies.

After installing run :
```bash
npm start
```
This opens the React Native bundler, which gets your code ready to be run on a mobile device.

Install the **expo** app on your mobile device from the App Store or Google Play Store. Scan the QR code from the React Native Bundler on your phone.
